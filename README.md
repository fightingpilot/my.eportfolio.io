        <p>
        CODA stands for <i>COVID-19 Dashboard</i>. The aim of the COVID-19 dashboard, developed by
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gil-salvans-torras-b4a231138/" target="_blank">Gil Salvans-Torras</a> and me, Eike Blomeier. This project consists of the development of a Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) with a thematical focus on the Covid19 pandemic in three countries: Austria, Germany, and Spain. In agreement with this, the infrastructure is continuously running and its data is updated in a daily basis automatically so the user can get a general understanding of the status of the pandemic in each of the aforementioned countries with the latest data through an interactive web application with different dashboards. To achieve this, this SDI can be divided in three stages. The first one, which regards to the daily data collection and setting it up into a geospatial database. Secondly, connecting the database to a GI Server to publish all the data as standard OGC services. Finally, a retrieval of the different services is carried out by the different dashboards of the web application.<br>
